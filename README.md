# Portfolio
I've been switching portfolio repos a lot, but, this time i feel i crushed it.
I always wanted a portfolio with some sort of 3D movement or style, so, in order to accomplish this i decided to learn Three.js and put myself to the test.
Naturally, i knew three.js could be expensive hardware wise, so i thought maybe if i coupled that with Solid.js, maybe we could fix the performance issues. So far so good, i really enjoy how the site looks and behaves.
